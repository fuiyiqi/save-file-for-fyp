The Ticketing System will be tightly integrated with the Test Scenario Tracking System to ensure seamless communication between quality assurance (QA) activities and issue management. This integration enhances traceability by linking individual tickets to their corresponding test cases and scenarios, allowing both development and QA teams to track defects within the context of the tests that identified them.
When QA testers execute test scenarios and encounter a failure, the failed test case will automatically trigger a REST API call to the Ticketing System. This will create a new ticket pre-filled with relevant details from the test scenario, such as the expected behavior, test case identifier and reporter. Testers can then document the actual behavior observed, attach supporting evidence (e.g., screenshots, logs), and provide additional notes to describe the issue in detail. Before the ticket is confirmed as a valid issue, it must go through an approval step to ensure that false positives or misconfigurations are not mistakenly logged as defects.
For regression testing or large-scale module testing, multiple testers may report failures against the same scenario. In such cases, the lead QA for the module will be responsible for reviewing and approving the tickets generated. Duplicate tickets related to the same failed scenario can be merged into a single issue, reducing redundancy and ensuring that development teams are not overwhelmed with repeated reports of the same problem. This consolidation helps maintain a cleaner and more manageable ticket log while still preserving traceability back to the individual test cases.
Once the development team resolves the issue, the resolution status of the ticket will be sent back to the Test Scenario Tracking System. The corresponding test case will then be automatically updated to reflect that the issue has been addressed and can be re-tested. If the fix passes the re-test, the scenario will be marked as “Passed,” ensuring that the defect resolution process directly feeds into the quality assurance workflow.
Additional potential integrations could include:

Bi-directional updates → Any changes to ticket status (e.g., reopened, deferred, blocked) are automatically reflected in the Test Scenario Tracking System to keep QA in sync.

Automated test execution links → Tickets could store direct references or links to the failed automated test scripts or reports for faster debugging.

Metrics and reporting → Combined dashboards showing defect density per test scenario, average time from defect creation to resolution, and re-test success rates.

Knowledge base integration → Once a recurring issue is resolved, both the ticket and the test scenario could be linked to a knowledge base entry for future reference.
